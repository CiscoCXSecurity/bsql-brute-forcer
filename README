This perl scripts will allow you to retrieve the result of any arbitrary sql query in  blind sql injection scenarios.

It supports two modes of operation (-type):-
0. Blind Injection when application returns different responses for True and False cases e.g in integer based injection "index.php?id=1 and 1=1" returns page 1 but "id=1 and 1=2" returns page 2 <Default>
1. Blind Injection when application returns different responses for true and error cases e.g in integer based injection "index.php?id=1 and 1=1" returns page 1 ALSO "id=1 and 1=2" returns page 1 BUT "id=1';shit-- " returns syntax error

I have described the later condition in more details at:- http://www.notsosecure.com/folder2/2008/05/26/if-query-data-manipulation/

It supports following databases (-database):-
0. MS-SQL <Default>
1. MySQl 
2. Postgres
3. Oracle 

This is not a click and hack tool, it will only do the job which you tell it to do and it's alwayas good to use the -proxy switch to see what the tool is sending.

Injection in both integer and string fileds is supported, a string based injection must end with a quotes e.g url="http://192.168.1.1/inject.php?id=blah'"
Custom SQL queries supplied with the switch (-sql) should only return one row. Use the concatenation functions in the sql queries to get more than one columns.
I recommend the use of -match switch to give the true response which only occurs when condition is true. 

Refer to SQL Injection Cheatsheet http://ferruh.mavituna.com/sql-injection-cheatsheet-oku/, http://pentestmonkey.net/blog/sqlics-managing-users/ for useful queries.

TODO.. 
1. Add/hardcode More SQL queries, like dumping tables etc.
2. Add 'waitfor delay' feature in MS-SQL
3. Add false response match. 
4. Learn more perl scripting

In some distro's threaded perl seg faults. Works fine under windows with active perl and under debian.
